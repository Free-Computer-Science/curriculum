# Overview

## Course Structure

### 1-26
These are the core courses and you should be familiar with them as much as possible. You can begin The Algorithms course after lesson 20, but I do reccommend at least working
through the first 26 lessons before starting intro to systems.

### 27-32

These lessons are for people who have been dilligent in learning C and have some experience through the projects. They are good for experienced folk and this course is written out in such a way that you will be ready for them by the time you get there.
If you do the projects, you should be more than ready to handle complex ideas and challenges thrown your way.


## A Note:
This isn't designed to take you from 0 to Job. Therefore, you should take this at the right pace for you to learn it. The goal here is to learn and more than that: To deeply understand (or "grok") the material (which is where the AI system for X got its name.) 

## Why C?

1. Lingua Franca of CS
2. Memory Management up the B-Hole
3. Historically significant language
4. You will miss a LOT if you don't choose to learn C (Systems, networking, OS, distributed systems)
5. If you can learn C, you can learn any language
6. It isn't as scary as it seems. It's just old.
