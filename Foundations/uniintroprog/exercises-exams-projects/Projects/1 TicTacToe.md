# Tic Tac Toe

In this project, you will build Tic Tac Toe, a simple game that you will have played before. How you choose to implement it is up to you, but it should follow the rules of the game, check for a win state, and announce a winner.

BONUS: See if you can implement a rudamentary "AI" that can play as a "computer."
