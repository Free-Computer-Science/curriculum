# Overview of Projects

There are plenty of projects that exist at all levels, however these 12 projects exist to help you grow and develop your skills as a C programmer. While many of these will be familiar to you, implementing them through C will be more difficult. C doesn't give you as much as other languages, and a lot of the data structures we will later implement have to be done so by hand, making it a perfect language for learning the heart of computer science. While any language can be used to create these, lots of them give you predefined functions, methods, classes and objects to do things like: 
1. work with strings safely
2. give you basic sorting and searching algorithms
3. give you tools for ai creation and Neural Network development
4. Give you simple tools to draw GUIs on screen. 

These things are obfusticated from you when you use other languages like python and Java. However they are not in the standard library for C. Therefore, there may come a point where you want to learn how an algorithm works, or how something is implemented. That is the heart of why we are using C. 

With that note, here are the projects for you to build in this course: 

1. TicTacToe
2. Rock Paper and Scissors
3. Hangman
4. Calculator
5. Character Frequency Counter
6. Prime Number Generator
7. Dynamic Memory Allocator
8. Build your own String library
9. Linked Lists
10. Binary Search Trees
11. Command Line Text Editor (Harder Project for new People!)
12. Custom Memory Manager (Get ready for Systems!)


The Later ones will challenge you! That is the nature of them. For your sake and no one else's please avoid using LLMs for these. While GPTs are an amazing and wonderful tool (and you should find a way to have them in your life!) The reality is that they will not replace developers anytime soon. On top of that, there are issues that math-based GPTs can't solve and when you are working in very old, complex code (which you will probably do at some point in your career, take it from an Enterprise Developer working on code from the early 90's), they simply fall apart due to a lack of context (which we will not discuss right now as it is far too advanced to get into at the moment.)

For now, do the very best you can with them and you will be okay! If you are worried about writing unsafe code, don't be afraid, every one has done it. I have written purposefully unsafe code in some of the examples. If you play with it, you will find that it is quite easy to overreach outside of an array or a string.
