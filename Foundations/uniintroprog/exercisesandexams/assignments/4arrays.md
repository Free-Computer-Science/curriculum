1. Basic Array Declaration and Access

Write a program that declares an array of 10 integers, initializes it with values from 1 to 10, and prints each value.

Objective: Understand how to declare, initialize, and access array elements.
2. Summing Array Elements

Write a program that declares an array of 5 floating-point numbers, initializes them, and calculates the sum of all the elements. Print the result.

Objective: Practice using arrays to store and process data, particularly with floating-point numbers.
3. Finding the Maximum in an Array

Write a program that accepts 10 integer inputs from the user, stores them in an array, and finds the maximum value.

Objective: Learn how to iterate through arrays and compare values.
4. Reversing an Array

Write a program that declares an array of 8 characters, initializes it with the string "Cprogram", and prints the array in reverse order.

Objective: Practice iterating over arrays in reverse and handling character arrays.
5. Array as Function Argument

Write a program that declares an array of 6 integers, initializes it, and passes it to a function that prints each element of the array.

Objective: Understand how arrays are passed to functions by reference.
6. Multidimensional Array (Matrix) Operations

Write a program that declares a 3x3 matrix of integers, initializes it with values from 1 to 9, and prints the matrix in matrix format (rows and columns).

Objective: Practice working with 2D arrays and formatting output.
7. Summing Rows and Columns of a 2D Array

Using a 3x3 matrix, write a program that calculates and prints the sum of each row and each column.

Objective: Understand how to access elements in a 2D array and perform operations row-wise and column-wise.
8. Array Indexing with Pointers

Write a program that declares an array of 5 integers and uses pointer arithmetic to print each element of the array.

Objective: Learn how arrays and pointers are closely related and how pointer arithmetic can be used to access array elements.
9. Dynamic Array Size Calculation

Declare an integer array of size 6, initialize it, and use the sizeof operator to calculate the total size of the array in bytes and the number of elements in the array. Print the results.

Objective: Practice using sizeof to calculate array sizes.
10. Common Pitfalls: Out-of-Bounds Access

Write a program that declares an array of 4 integers and attempts to access the 6th element of the array. Print the value of the out-of-bounds element and observe the behavior.

Objective: Demonstrate what happens when accessing out-of-bounds elements, leading to undefined behavior.
Explanation:
    In this exercise, you declare an array with 4 elements, but you try to access the 5th index (which doesn't exist in the array). This results in undefined behavior, which means the program might print garbage values, crash, or behave unpredictably depending on the system.
    The purpose of this exercise is to emphasize the importance of avoiding out-of-bounds access and carefully checking array indices during development.
