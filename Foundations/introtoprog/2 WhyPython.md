# Why Learn Python

## Learning Objectives
1. Become Familiar with Python and its environment
2. Understand how to navigate the Python website, look through documentation, and read guides
3. Understand the pros and cons of why people use certain languages and features when building a system.


## Guiding Questions: 
1. Why are there so many programming languages in the world today?
2. During the lesson, look at examples of Java, Python, and C code. What makes them different? What makes them similar?
3. At the end of this lesson, think of some reasons why or why not someone would want to use a programming languages. Does how a language is built impact developers choice in a programming language?

Welcome to Python! Python is an incredibly popular, easy-to-learn, and simple to read language, with rich support for a variety of extra functionality (called modules and frameworks, which we will look at later) and is used everywhere from the unseen backend, to data analytics, to AI and ML development.

Because of this most, if not all, major universities and organizations start new students in Python. Of course, this gets met with some criticism as everyone has opinions about what language is best to start in. We'll look at why people do and do not like Python later, but for now, let's just look at Python's features and History

## The History of Python
*ACTIVITY* Go to the Python Wikipage and summarize in your own words the history of Python. What were some reasons as to why it was created?

Back in the 1980s, good, simple languages were starting to become popular. We'll look more in-depth at this in a different course **Historical Programming**. BASIC, Smalltalk and others had already hit the scene, and were foundational in creating the developers that would go onto shape the modern world (Think Apple or Google). However, this wasn't enough for Guido Van Ross, Python's longtime lead developer. There were features missing from other languages that Van Ross wanted in his language. By 1994, Python version 1 was alive and kicking and slowing gaining popularity. By 2000, Van Ross and the team released Python version 2, a significant upgrade from version 1. We don't care about the changes or unique features as those are beyond the scope of this class and would be meaningless to you, a new programmer. However, feel free to go look for yourself what changes have been made.

By this point, developers were already looking towards the future, to version 3 and the birth of the modern internet. By 2008, version 3 had been released, coinciding with the birth of the iPhone, the rise of social media, and the introduction of web applications. While version 2 and 3 did exist at the same time, they were not cross-compatible, with version 3 breaking many aspects of version 2. Python 2.7 was the final release in 2014, with full support until 2020 and on April 20th, 2020, the final bug fix for Python2 was released, marking the end-of-life for Python2.

The current release, at the time of writing, is 3.12, with 3.13 expected to release on October 2024. Python3 will remain fully supported and Van Roff and the developer team currently does not have plans for a Python4. For now, Python 3 is the current and best version for Python.


## Python's Philosophy

Python 3 was made with several principles in mind, something to consider as we learn it: 



    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.[c]
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than right now.[d]
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea â€“ let's do more of those!

These aphorisms, called the Zen of Python, have had an influence on other languages and developers. Ruby and Go are both languages that easily follow these "Pythonic" statements and should you chose either of those language paths, you will find their similarities to Python almost striking.

*QUESTIONS: Do you like the Zen of Python, why or why not? Is there a time or reason that developers should or shouldn't follow these ideas?*

You will find as you grow as a developer, computer scientist, or programmer, that you will begin to form your own opinions on what is best for a language, framework, or system. The biggest, most important idea is that these statements are guidelines at best, and heavily debated ones too. *Go Google Python pros and cons* As you look at the language, you will find that lots of people have their own opinions on the language. Some say that it is too slow, the modules are cumbersome to install, support is complicated and the changes from Python2 to Python3 were awful at best, and catastrophic at worst.

Again, you do not have to have an opinion on the matter and for right now you shouldn't. Your focus should be on learning how to program and more importantly, learning how to learn!


While I always try to promise an ACT and DO portions of the lesson, your act and do will come in the next lesson: Installing and Setting Up Python.
